Create a responsive layout with the following properties:

  1) Fixed position header and footer which span the entire width of the page.
  2) 4 columns for desktop resolutions, 2 columns for portrait tablet, and 1 column for phone.
  3) Column 1 should contain an ordered list of 10 items with alternating background colors.
  4) Column 2 should contain a div with 5px rounded corners.
  5) Column 3 should contain a div with horizontally and vertically centered text which spans multiple lines.
  6) Column 4 should contain and image which takes up the full width of the column.
  7) Cross-browser compatible.  IE9+.  Graceful degradation for IE8 where appropriate.

This should represent production-ready code, so show us code you would be proud to deploy.
Do not worry about the design looking pretty, we just want to see the code.
